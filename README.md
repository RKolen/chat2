The API.
https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/rkolen/API-Raymond-2.0/1.0.1

Goal: the goal was to create an API that works with the chat from previous week.

- Develop a REST protocol for chatapplications
- Create a RESTfull API in PHP
- Document the API via swagger.io
- Use the SCRUM methods

the assignment was divided in 3 tiers: 	Tier 1 get a fixed response.
					Tier 2 create a Flatfile datastructure.
					Tier 3 create an SQL database.

Wednesday T1 was added (very barebones).
Thursday the PUT and GET requestmethods were created.
Friday T2 was complete.

One side note: the idea was that we all would use the same API documentation. 
It was my understanding that the API documentation would mimic that of the previous week. 
Upon inspecting the API documentation, it seemed it did not. 
I did attempt to change my code to match the documentation written but was not able to get it to work, yet.

Assignment 2:

The goal is to create a REST protocol for chatapplications.
Using PHP create a RESTfull API, documented using swagger.io.
During the project use the SCRUM method.

3 tiers defined for the assignment are as follows:
T1: A fixed response, using PHP to return a fixed message.
T2: Using a flatfile datastructure, and link it to the chat function of assignment 1.
T3: Using an SQL database.

Approach:

After reading documententation I tried to find tutorials how to make an API in PHP.
To practice I wrote the code and added to the repository.
I made a simple function to return a fixed response.
Using the API tutorial to create my own PUT and GET requestmethods and couple it to my own chat.
